# Ampl!tude
Computer Science and Mathematics DEC Final Project
Realised with Charlotte Sarrazin

This software allows people to animate shapes based on the amplitude of a song and/or based on the amplitude of specific frequencies (frequencies analyzed using the Fast Fourrier Transform).
For example one could add a rectangle to the scene and make its height move based on when a kick drum (frequency around 100-120Hz) hits. Multiples other shapes could then be added and animated differently.

You can download the runnable jar file here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7w5FuHl8_jkNzVnbm5tM1Z6cEk/view?usp=sharing

Once open, you can open 3 presets to experiment with this software or open up the tutorial which will give you basic guidelines as to how to create your fist project!

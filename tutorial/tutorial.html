            <p style="font-size: 15px;"><em>An example of what can be achieved using Ampl!tude</em></p>
            
            <h2>Step 1:</h2>
            <p>When opening the application, you will be prompted to either open an existing project or to create a new one. For this tutorial, select the option <strong>Create a new project with a sound file</strong> and click the <strong>Browse</strong> button to select and <strong>.wav</strong> sound file you would like. When you are satisfied with your selection, press <strong>Open</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Step 2:</h2>
            <p>You should now have the main view of the application open. To start creating your custom animation, click on the <strong>Rectangle</strong> button on the left side of the window. This will automatically add a rectangle shape to the canvas.</p>

            <h2>Step 3:</h2>
            <p>You can now edit the shape as you wish, by using the tools on the left side of the window, under the <strong>Edit The Shape</strong> title. Note that you can also edit the background by simply clicking on it. Clicking on a shape will then get you back to the <strong>Edit The Shape</strong> menu.</p>

            <h2>Step 4:</h2>
            <p>In order to make your shape move as the song progresses, you need to add <strong>Reactions</strong> to it. To do so, click on the rectangle you just created to select it, then click on the <strong>Add a reaction</strong> button on the right side of the window.</p>
            <img src="step4_1.png" width=250>
            <p>A new window should now open, allowing you to create a custom reaction.<br>
                First, select a reaction type. An <strong>Amplitude</strong> reaction will make the shape react based on how loud the song is, and a <strong>Frequency</strong> reaction will affect the shape based on how loud a specific frequency band is (For example, a drum in a song will generate a big frequency band around 20-100Hz).<br>
                Second, select the shape's property that will be affected by this reaction. A reaction can currently affect the size of a shape or its color.

            <img src="step4_2.png" width=400>
            <p>Then enter a <strong>minimum</strong> and a <strong>maximum</strong> value that will modify the shape property that you selected. Keep in mind that those values should be decimals, 1 being the property doesn't change and 2 being it doubles. If you selected a <strong>Frequency</strong> reaction, you will also need to enter a range of frequencies that will affect this shape.</p>

            <h2>Step 5:</h2>
            <p>Use the <strong>Audio Player</strong>, located at the top of the window, to <strong>Play</strong> the song and watch the result of what you created! If the sound is too loud, use the <strong>Slider</strong> on the right to lower the volume.</p>

            <h2>Step 6:</h2>
            <p><strong>Have fun!!</strong><br>You now know everything you need to start creating your custom animations. Express your creativity, try new things and share your creations with your friends!</p>
